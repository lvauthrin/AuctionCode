This package should contain the following files:
- Auction.bat: Used for running the Auction unit tests
- AuctionComplete.bat: Used for running the Auction unit tests (see below)
- Auction.jar: Class files for Auction code and JUnit
- Auction-sources.jar: Source code for the Auction code
- Readme.txt: This file

The two batch files execute two different Auction implementations:
Auction.bat - Finds the winner without running the auction
AuctionComplete.bat - Finds the winner running each step of the auction

There are a lot of source files there because of the two different 
implementations but it should still be well organized since the
different implementations share an interface and inherit common
code via an abstract class.

The source was built using JDK 1.6 and JUnit 4.3.
